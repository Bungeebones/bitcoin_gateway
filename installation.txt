Assuming you have the bitcoin server running on your VPS and assuming you have Apache, MySql, Php and Curl also installed 
there then the first step is to configure this script to connect to your database using the db2bbconfiga.php file in the 
db_cfg folder.

You will eventually need to create a db named testnet and use the included sql file to install the three tables (watching, 
archived, and move_to+cold tables). That can be done now or after configuring and testing your RPC JSon connection to the
Bitcoin server.

The easiest way to do that is to make the changes to the RPC user name and password in the test_bitcoin.php and the test_bitcoin_rpc.php 
files. 

First, make sure you configured RPC user and password in the bitcoin.conf file of the bitcoin server like this
server=1
daemon=1
testnet=1

rpcuser=CreateYourUserName
rpcpassword=CreateYourPassword$$$###***

THEN OPEN (IN A BROWSER) www.yourVPS.com/testbitcoin.php. Assuming the server is running it should display Bitcoin info.
