Assuming you have the bitcoin server running on your VPS and assuming you have Apache, MySql, Php and Curl also installed 
there then the first step is to configure this script to connect to your database using the db2bbconfiga.php file in the 
db_cfg folder.

You will eventually need to create a db named testnet and use the included sql file to install the three tables (watching, 
archived, and move_to+cold tables). That can be done now or after configuring and testing your RPC JSon connection to the
Bitcoin server.

The easiest way to do that is to make the changes to the RPC user name and password in the test_bitcoin.php and the test_bitcoin_rpc.php 
files. 

First, make sure you configured RPC user and password in the bitcoin.conf file of the bitcoin server like this
server=1
daemon=1
testnet=1

rpcuser=CreateYourUserName
rpcpassword=CreateYourPassword$$$###***

THEN OPEN (IN A BROWSER) www.yourVPS.com/testbitcoin.php. Assuming the server is running it should display Bitcoin info.

Once the RPC connection is established with the bitcoin server then make the same configuration change towards the 
beginning of the process_testnet.php page.

Install the database and tables (if you haven't already).

Install the index_os.php file (copy it from inside the REMOTE_SHARED_HOST_INDEX_FILE folder of the download) into your 
remote shared server website files. In that file there is one configuration that will send curl requests to the VPS and 
you need to insert the address there.

You also will need to fool the script into believing you are a user of the shared server by HARDCODING a user id. The
user id will be used to create a unique account for that user (and from that unique account the script will create
unlimited new addresses for the user to submit Bitcoin payments to). 

Visit that page on your shared server from a browser. If everything is configured correctly then the page should display
